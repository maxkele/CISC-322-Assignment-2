            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <p>The result of our findings were first presented as a 10 minute slideshow. The feedback recieved from this presentation informed us on what changes needed to be made, and what to look into further.</p>

            <h2>Report</h2>
            <p>Using the feedback we recieved during our presentation we corrected and expanded our findings, and have compiled a more in-depth report.</p>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>This report is a presentation of our analysis of the Google Chrome web browser, which was developed as part of the Chromium open-source project . Our mission was to develop a conceptual architecture of Google Chrome using the existing documentation. Through this research, we came to a predominantly Object Oriented architecture. We will go into further detail regarding the architecture style and the subsystems present, as well as how we arrived at this model. We will explore the functionality of our architecture through two sequence diagrams, depicting different use cases. Finally, we will conclude with team issues and lessons learned. This report will act as a foundation when developing a particular architecture in the future.</p>
